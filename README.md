# Costco Metals Tracker

A real-time tracking website that monitors the availability of silver and gold products on Costco's website. Built with a clean, modern Apple-inspired design.

## Features

- **Live Tracking**: Monitors Costco's precious metals inventory in real-time
- **Product Filtering**: Easily filter products by type (silver/gold) and availability
- **Restock Patterns**: View historical restock patterns and probability data
- **Mobile Responsive**: Clean design that works on all device sizes
- **Browser Notifications**: Get notified when products come back in stock

## How It Works

This tracker checks Costco's website for precious metals inventory and displays the current status. In a production environment, it would use web scraping or API calls to fetch real-time data from Costco. For demonstration purposes, the current implementation simulates inventory checks.
